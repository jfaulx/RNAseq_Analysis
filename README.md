# Welcome! This is an RShiny app that I created to help analyze and visualize trends in RNA sequencing data.
 
You can find the app hosted here: https://jacksonfaulx.shinyapps.io/rnaseqapp/ 

The app is still being actively worked on and I am looking to add new features regularly

The app currently allows you to upload a RNAseq raw counts file as well as a meta data file, formatted as seen below

Counts file:

Example files can also be found in this repo 

Thank you! I hope you enjoy
