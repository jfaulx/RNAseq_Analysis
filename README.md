# Welcome! 
## This is an RShiny app that I created to help analyze and visualize trends in RNA sequencing data.
 
You can find the app hosted here: https://jacksonfaulx.shinyapps.io/rnaseqapp/ 

The app is still being actively worked on and I am looking to add new features regularly. It currently allows you to upload a RNAseq raw counts file as well as a meta data file, formatted as seen below


Counts file: Needs to have gene IDs as row names and samples as columns, counts data should be non-normalized and non-filtered

Meta data: Should have columns containing sample information

Example files can also be found in this repo 

Thank you! I hope you enjoy
